When using Google Form post type, the <em>wpgform</em> shortcode accepts one parameter, <em>id</em>, which is the post id of the form.  When using the <strong>deprecated</strong> <em>gform</em> shortcode, the only required parameter is <code>form</code> which is set to the URL to the Google Form URL.  Recommended but optional, you can also provide a custom URL for a confirmation page if you don't care for the default Google text.
